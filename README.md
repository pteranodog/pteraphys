# PteraPhys
PteraPhys is a work-in-progress physics simulator that I am creating as a side project. I plan to use it both to learn more about physics simulation, and as a basis for future ideas that I may have. This simulation library is not meant to be better than things like Box2D or other common physics simulation libraries! It is intended purely for my own education and future use.

## Things that hopefully will be added, in no particular order
- [X] Vectors
- [X] Point masses
- [X] Circle area constraints
- [X] Link constraints
- [X] A simulation class to handle global properties
- [ ] More types and properties for point masses
- [ ] Proper collision with true restitution coefficient
- [ ] Point mass generators
- [ ] Rectangle area constraints
- [ ] Polygonal area constraints
- [ ] Optimize collision test algorithm
